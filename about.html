		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>TelemeterED began as a collaborative project between the USC school of Cinematography and Chattanooga’s STEM School in 2013, to pioneer the field of telemicroscopy for education use.  A cinema-quality, UltraHD camera was connected to a microscope on the USC campus, and a live feed of slides used in this microscope was streamed across the nation to high school biology students at the STEM school.  

This project served to investigate how the newly established Gig could enable learning for high school students in ways that were previously unthinkable, providing them access to top of the line scientific equipment that is, in best cases, scarce to secondary education environments across the country.  

Since then, we have been hard at work to begin to expand the impact TelemeterED’s tech has, in Chattanooga, and someday soon, the entire country.  Our next step is to build a microscope hub station locally in Chattanooga, and to expand into more gig-enabled cities in the near future!</p>

		<h4>Christopher Guard Hunt </h4>
		<p>Christopher is a technologist and developer with TelemeterED and has a background in computer and information science. He is fascinated with the collision between technology driven innovation and relationally driven education. A perfect example of this interest is found in TelemeterED, which is on the leading edge of gig-enabled technology and has its roots deeply set in an experiential learning paradigm. </p>
