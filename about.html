		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>TelemeterED began as a collaborative project between the USC school of Cinematography and Chattanooga’s STEM School in 2013, to pioneer the field of telemicroscopy for education use.  A cinema-quality, UltraHD camera was connected to a microscope on the USC campus, and a live feed of slides used in this microscope was streamed across the nation to high school biology students at the STEM school.  

This project served to investigate how the newly established Gig could enable learning for high school students in ways that were previously unthinkable, providing them access to top of the line scientific equipment that is, in best cases, scarce to secondary education environments across the country.  

Since then, we have been hard at work to begin to expand the impact TelemeterED’s tech has, in Chattanooga, and someday soon, the entire country.  Our next step is to build a microscope hub station locally in Chattanooga, and to expand into more gig-enabled cities in the near future!</p>

		<h2>STEM Education</h2>
		<p>Our focus are STEM fields, and currently we are in the biology classroom where experiential learning through student research can be real, alive, and close up. Students get the opportunity to see and understand what actual science looks like and be active participants in their own learning.</p>

		<h2>The Tech.</h2>
		
		<h4>Microscope</h4>
		<p>We work with research-grade microscopes employed by scientists, hospitals, and universities. Students can work with technology being used by professionals and conduct real-world experiments from their own classrooms.
</p>
		
		<h4>4K Camera</h4>
		<p>Employing the latest cinematography videography, students can view microscopic worlds in ultra-high definition and dive-into science like never before. 
</p>
		
		<h4>Gigabit Connectivity</h4>
		<p>With a metro-wide fiber-optic footprint, gig-cities allow local classes and schools to directly wire into light-speed networking and receive 4k video streams in live-time.

		<h2>Meet The Team</h2>
		
		<h4>Zach Kies</h4>
		<p>Program manager for the TelemeterED team, Zach is a 2016 UW-Madison graduate that became involved with TelemeterED through the Gigtank summer program. I have a engineering and information technology background, and am passionate about using technology outreach to improve the educational prospects for children & adults!
</p>
		
		<h4>Fritsl Butler</h4>
		<p>Fritsl is a Chattanooga native and 2011 Sewanee graduate with 5 years of teaching and curriculum design experience in independent schools. Fritsl is eager to explore ways in which technology can be leveraged to improve education for traditional and nontraditional students from all backgrounds, especially in her hometown.
</p>
		
		<h4>Shannon Seigle</h4>
		<p>Shannon is a curriculum consultant for TelemeterED as she piloted the 4K Microscopy project with her Biology class in Spring 2015 at STEM School Chattanooga. A 2000 graduate of Barry University and a teacher of 19 years, Shannon is dedicated to changing the paradigm of what science looks like in the classroom through inquiry, collaboration and innovation.
</p>
		
		<h4>Christopher Guard Hunt</h4>
		<p>Christopher is a technologist and developer with TelemeterED and has a background in computer and information science. He is fascinated with the collision between technology driven innovation and relationally driven education. A perfect example of this interest is found in TelemeterED, which is on the leading edge of gig-enabled technology and has its roots deeply set in an experiential learning paradigm.
