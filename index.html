		<p>TelemeterED is building experiential learning platforms to connect STEM students with research-grade technologies and pioneer educational applications in the gigabit community. By leveraging the power of the gigabit infrastructure, TelemeterED is bringing previously unavailable resources into the classroom, empowering both teachers and students to have direct agency in exploring science. </p>

	<h2>Tele-Microscopy</h2>
	<p>During the summer of 2016, TelemeterED is scaling the 4k Microscope experience to implement the platform in 5 school in Chattanooga, TN. The system gives students and teachers remote access and control to a 4k microscope, allowing them to conduct experiments with live specimens on a research-grade digital, motorized microscope and view and store the video data at ultra-high resolutions.</p>
	
	<br />
	<h2>Pilot Project with USC</h2>
	<p>In 2014, a pilot was conducted between The STEM School in Chattanooga and the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles. Students at STEM were able to conduct personalized research with locally collected, live specimens and receive input and instruction from Dr. Richard Weinberg, research professor at USC School of Cinematic Arts, and inventor of the 4k tele-microscopy project.</p>
